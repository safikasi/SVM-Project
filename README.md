https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*7bnLKsChXq94QjtAiRn30w.jpeg

## 📌 Project Overview
**This project demonstrates the implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish between three species of Iris flowers:**

- Iris setosa

- Iris versicolor

- Iris virginica

Using the famous Fisher's Iris dataset, we explore feature analysis, model training, and evaluation metrics to achieve high classification accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Scikit-learn (for SVM implementation)

- Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)

- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

## 📊 Dataset Features
**The dataset contains 150 samples with 4 features each:**

- Sepal Length (cm)

- Sepal Width (cm)

- Petal Length (cm)

- Petal Width (cm)

## 🚀 Project Steps
**Data Loading & Exploration**

- Load the Iris dataset using sklearn.datasets.

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.

- Data Preprocessing

- Split data into training and testing sets.

- Standardize features for better SVM performance.

- Model Training

- Train an SVM classifier with different kernels (linear, rbf, poly).

- Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.

- Model Evaluation

- Assess performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

- Visualize decision boundaries.

## Results & Conclusion

- Compare model performance across different kernels.

- Determine the best model for Iris classification.

## 📈 Key Results

- Achieved >95% accuracy with optimized SVM.

- Linear kernel performed best for this dataset.

- Petal measurements were more discriminative than sepal measurements.
